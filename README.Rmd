<!-- badges: end -->

A user-friendly factor-like interface for converting strings of text into numeric vectors and rectangular data structures.

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of wactor from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("wactor")
```
-->

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/mkearney/wactor) with:

``` r
## install {remotes} if not already
if (!requireNamespace("remotes")) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}
## install wactor for github
remotes::install_github("mkearney/wactor")
```
## Example

Here's some basic text (e.g., natural language) data:

```{r example}
## load wactor package
library(wactor)

## text data (sentences)
x <- c(
  "This test is a test",
  "This one will be a test",
  "This this was a test",
  "And this is the fourth test",
  "Fifth: the test!",
  "And the sixth test",
  "This is the seventh test",
  "This test is going to be a test",
  "This one will have been a test",
  "This this has been a test"
)

## for demonstration purposes, store as a data frame as well
data <- tibble::tibble(
  text = x,
  value = rnorm(length(x)),
  z = c(rep(TRUE, 7), rep(FALSE, 3))
)
```


### `split_test_train()`

A convenience function for splitting an input object into test and train data 
frames. This is often useful for splitting a single data frame:

```{r}
## split into test/train data sets
split_test_train(data)
```

By default, `split_test_train()` returns 80% of the input data in the `train`
data set and 20% of the input data in the `test` data set. This proportion of
data used in the returned training data can be adjusted via the `.p` argument:

```{r}
## split into test/train data sets–with 70% of data in training set
split_test_train(data, .p = 0.70)
```

When predicting categorical variables, it's often desireable to ensure the 
training data set has an even number of observations for each level in the 
response variable. This can be achieved by indicating the [column] name of the 
categorical response variable using tidy evaluation. This will prioritize evenly
balanced observations over the specified proportion in training data:

```{r}
## ensure evenly balanced groups in `train` data set
split_test_train(data, .p = 0.70, z)
```

The `split_test_train()` doesn't only work on data frames. It's also possible to 
split atomic vectors (i.e., character, numeric, logical):

```{r}
## OR split character vector into test/train data sets
(d <- split_test_train(x))
```


### `wactor()`

Use `wactor()` to convert a character vector into a `wactor` object. The code
below uses the previously split [into test/train] text data `d` described above.

```{r}
## create wactor
w <- wactor(d$train$x)
```

### `dtm()`

Get the document term frequency matrix

```{r}
## term frequency–inverse document frequency
dtm(w)

## same thing as dtm
predict(w)
```

### `tfidf()`

or term frequency–inverse document frequency matrix

```{r}
## apply to other data
tfidf(w)
```

Or apply the wactor on **new data**

```{r}
## document term frequecy of new data
dtm(w, d$test$x)

## same thing as dtm
predict(w, d$test$x)

## term frequency–inverse document frequency of new data
tfidf(w, d$test$x)
```
